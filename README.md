# MakuMatch

This project uses [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) with [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main).

## Purpose

Prototype for frontend of an app that would help people discover new recipes through a familiar feed interface with swiping gestures. Also includes e.g. a recipe library and traditional search function. Initially part of courswork for the course Käyttäjälähtöinen tuotekehitysprojekti.

## How to run

Clone the repository and then run

    npm install
    npx expo start
  
this will install the project dependencies and start expo go (to view the app on a phone with the Expo Go app).

## Credits

The MakuMatch name and concept were developed by our group.

The code for this app was written by Pekko Eskola.
